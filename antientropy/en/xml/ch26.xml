            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">The former Empire State Building—— Now known as Welt Obelisk.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">Now I truly feel like Manhattan is back.</speak>

            <speak chara="newsNoFace">General Mechatronics went through rough times after the 「Thanksgiving Disaster」, but now reborn as ME Company they've become one of the Fortune 500 companies in the world.</speak>

            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">Then suddenly the security guard on duty started banging on my door.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">I was sleeping and he pulled me out to the street while I was still wearing my pajamas.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">That's when I realized the city's electric network wasn't working.</speak>
