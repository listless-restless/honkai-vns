            <text>Less than an hour away from Quito, the mountainous landscape on the equatorial region was like a painting to the passengers.</text>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">In ancient times, civilization could only be nurtured in these valleys - This terrain has good weather, abundance of water and great fertility.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">As soon as the kings conquered a province, the first thing they would do is focus on increasing farmland and pasture.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">They would dig canals and level the land, and then the excess people and refugees would be settled into the new village.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">They wouldn’t stop at only the valleys, but also choose hills and mountains with good soil to build terraces on.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">They start by building three solid walls along the mountain, slightly inclined inwards to be able to bear the weight of the soil that they would be filled with, until it reached the height of the walls.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">After the first level is complete, you can build a smaller one above them until you reach the top of the mountain.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">Later the kingdom would expand into coastal deserts where it never rains and where there are no rivers to open canals; But they still found a way to cultivate the land.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">They would build villages near the sea and dig holes down to the sea level according to each one’s needs; That way the crops would get the water they need.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">And because the fertility of those lands tends to be poor, they would bury sardine heads alongside the seeds.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ShigureKira">That area is the same place where sardines are produced, thus they turned waste into treasure.</speak>
