                <p class="article-text">It was this series of betrayals that made the man named “Napoleon Bonaparte” finally become the version written in history.</p>
            </text>
            <text>He had long gotten accustomed to being betrayed, and was even proud of it.</text>
            <text>No matter what the situation is… as long as there was a chance for a comeback, he would definitely continue to move forward.</text>
            <text>--The word “failure” was never in his dictionary.</text>
            <text>In previous wars, limited by equipment, supplies, morale and luck, he also had to helplessly surrender, and was afraid that a comeback would not be possible.</text>
            <text>However, all of that, to this day, is nothing more than history he has long trampled on.</text>
            <text>He was defeated by the Russian “General Winter”, and the enemy’s coalition commander drove straight and directly occupied Paris.</text>
            <text>But in the blink of an eye, he sneaked out of Elba Island and went back to his homeland, with all of Bourbon's army turning to his side.</text>
            <text>However, the subsequent battle of Waterloo brought the Hundred Days to a hasty end. He was punished with exile for the second time, now to the distant South Atlantic Ocean--</text>
            <text>But just when everyone thought that the Emperor’s life would not bring any new upheavals, he who was in his twilight years, was involved in the experiments of the “Snake” and sent to another world by mistake. He regained his throne.</text>
            <text>However, his life that should have been smooth sailing was corrupted by greed: In order to permanently master this mighty power, he tried to activate the ancient civilization’s device to control this microverse.</text>
            <text>...Therefore turning all of his subjects into inhuman existences. </text>

            <text>But even so, the emperor did not give up.</text>
            <text>After a brief period of grief, he realized that this was just the beginning of a greater journey--</text>
            <text>He and his surviving subjects had just transformed from a lifeform that “consumes chemical energy” into another lifeform that “consumes Honkai Energy”.</text>
            <text>The position of emperor remains solid. The empire's military power was better than ever.</text>
            <text>After a brief dispute, the subjects of today became single-hearted, with a sincerity more enthusiastic and majestic than the previous “Era of Hymns”</text>
            <text>Although the new subjects needed a “Wall” to gradually transform the land under their feet - But to the emperor, this slow but sure expansion brought a different kind of calmness.</text>

            <text>Which is why, currently the emperor can be said to be extremely angry.</text>
            <text>He originally thought that, as the world gradually turned into one more suitable for his people’s lives, his enemies would only become weaker and less aggressive--</text>
            <text>However, those ants that only stay in their nest, the Girondin-like mobs, the stupid humans incapable of accepting the new form of life…</text>
            <text>They were able to disintegrate part of the world. They were able to destroy the sacred and energy filled territory of his empire.</text>
            <text>They were able to push the emperor into despair without losing a single soldier.</text>

            <text>...But that did not waver the emperor.</text>
            <text>He had lived for so long, that this was just a new form of “despair”.</text>
            <text>The enemy seemed to believe that the foundation of the empire’s existence was its sacred territory. </text>
            <text>“Without a land, a country cannot exist” - Usually, that would be true.</text>
            <text>However, thanks to the barrier of the “wall”, they could not infer that…</text>
            <text>...The emperor and his subjects had already become inseparable, and even if they were scattered in the void, there is still a way to preserve the core functions.</text>

            <text>The empire was built upon the principle of the “new life”.</text>
            <text>It would eventually break out of its cocoon and become a butterfly, breaking through the cage called “the world”.</text>
            <text>There will be no disease, no discrimination, no poverty, and no death.</text>
            <text>--And after that, an absolute understanding and absolute freedom.</text>
            <text>They will reach the resurrection promised by the prophet to the people, and they will bring judgement to all lower lifeforms.</text>
            <text>As of now, it is a creature that is both the emperor and his subjects. The only thing it did not understand is…</text>
            <text>...Why this blazing power, until today, had not been inherited and carried forward by anyone?</text>
            <text>After all, the source of this power was not “Napoleon Bonaparte” or any wise man from his era-</text>
            <text>This power originated from a secret from tens of thousands of years in the past. It is like a rising sun in the eclipse, unfortunately dying before it could give off light.</text>

            <text>Of course, they also have the “Caledonia” that can traverse this world’s unique underwater gusts and waves--</text>
