            <speak chara="_Schrodinger">Together we were able to pour enough energy to make a leap out of the abyss.</speak>
            <speak chara="_Schrodinger">But we were too far away from our original world——</speak>
            <speak chara="_Schrodinger">——There was no 「beacon」 to guide us back to our world. As such, we were unable to specify a landing point and had to 「leap」 blindly.</speak>
            <speak chara="_Schrodinger">...And as you all can see, we arrived 「here」, albeit in an incomplete state.</speak>

            <text>10 minutes later, a rough diamond, about the size of an eggplant, was brought from the Captain's room.</text>

            <text>「I'm ready」 she said. She extended her left hand towards the man behind her, and told him 「bring me the diamond」.</text>

            <text>She put the jewel next to the sword, and gently but steadily began to rub it, like putting margarine on a slice of bread.</text>

                <p class="article-text">严格来说，这个日期的前半部分（12.19.19.17.18）是属于长纪历的，而后半部分（2-燧石）则属于以260天为周期循环往复的“卓尔金历”（Tzolk'in，类似于干支系统）。</p>
                <p class="article-text">玛雅人的长纪历使用一连串向前进位的数字表示日期与年代，大致上以20为基数。日数的单位称为金（k'in），而20金为1乌纳（winal或uinal），18乌纳为1盾（tun，360天，约1年），20盾为1卡盾（k'atun，约19.7年），20卡盾为1伯克盾（bak'tun，约394.3年）。而比“伯克盾”更高、但极少被使用的四个单位，则依序为皮克盾（Pictun，约7885年）、卡拉盾（Calabtun，约157703年）、金奇盾（Kinchiltun，约3154069年）及阿托盾（Alautun，约63081377年）。</p>
                <p class="article-text">p.s. 在我们的世界里，2012年12月21日的长纪历对应数字是：13.0.0.0.0。（这让它有了所谓“世界末日”的意义。）</p>
