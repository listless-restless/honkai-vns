            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">Once upon a time, Iran had a ruler known as the 「Serpent King」.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">His name was Zahhak. He used to be a Prince from a remote frontier tribe before taking the throne.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">Zahhak was a small and slender but healthy man. Contrary to what his appearance would suggest, he was a curious and kind man at heart.</speak>
            <show chara="graySnakeNormal" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">One day, Zahhak fell down a cliff during a hunt and met a witch who called herself 「Grey Serpent」.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">The witch kissed the Prince's shoulders and his broken legs were healed. Rather, it would be correct to say they were stronger than before.</speak>
            <show chara="zahhakYoung" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">The Prince was overjoyed and asked the witch what she would like in return.</speak>
            <show chara="graySnakeSmile" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">「Grey Serpent」 simply smiled and told the Prince: 「O future King of Kings, your thanks are more than enough. For you will leave the realm of man and bring joy to us all.」</speak>
            <hide position="center"></hide>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">Back then, Zahhak was unaware of what kind of changes were occurring inside of him.</speak>
            <show chara="oldKingMoon" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">The Prince's father, Merdas, would always go out for a stroll at night in the palace's gardens. The King was surrounded by flowers and admiring the Moon when the Prince arrived, excited to tell him about what had happened to him.</speak>
            <show chara="oldKingNormal" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">「My dear son... what happened to you? You have such scary look on your face.」 The puzzled old man asked to his only son.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">But Zahhak did not answer. For some reason, the sight of his father wearing a crown and holding a scepter made him feel unusually hungry.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">His shoulders started to tingle so badly he began to scratch them with his hands. And then——</speak>
            <show chara="zahhakNormal" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">——A serpent's head came out from each shoulder.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">The Prince froze while the serpents, like an arrow, headed straight for the King's neck and bit him.</speak>
            <show chara="black" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">The confused Zahhak composed himself, took out his sword and slashed the serpents——</speak>
            <show chara="zahhakNormal" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">——But after cutting their heads, another one would grow from his shoulders.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">Meanwhile, the King was poisoned by the serpents and had bubbles coming out of his mouth.</speak>
            <show chara="zahhakSword" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">Zahhak could no longer endure his hunger,</speak>

            <show chara="bloodStain" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">and using his sword, he cut this father's head and fed his brain to the serpents.</speak>

            <show chara="zahhakSmile" position="center"/>

            <hide position="center"></hide>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">Afterwards, Zahhak ordered his subjects to bring him a criminal each night, and he fed their brains to the serpents.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">Soon after there were no more criminals. To escape from his guilt, Zahhak waged war against the other tribes, defeated them and put them on trial——</speak>
            <show chara="zahhakAxe" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">——And of course, he cut off the heads of those he found 「guilty」.</speak>
            <hide position="center"></hide>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">The 「Serpent King」 was no longer that small and weak Prince who once died during a hunt.</speak>
            <!-- TYPO: tore -> tear -->
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">He could tore apart his enemies with his bare hands, and his skin was so hard it could not be harmed by any weapon.</speak>
            <show chara="zahhakSmile" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">The 「Serpent King」's army continued to win battle after battle.</speak>
            <show chara="zahhakShah" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">He not only unified the tribes but took down the dynasty, and became known as the 「King of Kings」, the world's supreme ruler.</speak>
            <show chara="zahhakAxe" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">Then the 「King of Kings」 put in place strict laws in his country——</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">——Every day someone will be sentenced to death. All so he could feed their brain without remorse.</speak>
            <hide position="center"></hide>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">And so hundreds of years passed by.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">The 「Serpent King」 became old, his ways of governing no longer fitted the current era, and he became increasingly more violent——</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">——That was when finally a hero finally appeared.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">The hero led a subjugation force against Zahhak. However, Zahhak was immortal.</speak>
            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">Even after the hero cut off his head, the serpents continued to live and control his body.</speak>
            <show chara="zahhakNoHead" position="center"/>

            <speak chara="_zahhak">「I suppose your ancestors never told you why I'm called the 「Serpent King」!」</speak>

            <speak chara="_ZarathustraDaughter">「Ahh, poor King Zahhak. You made a grave mistake in the most crucial part. That is why you arrived at this pitiful ending.」 The witch said with a sad tone.</speak>

            <speak chara="_graySnake">I gave you a chance to stop being an animal and become human, but you chose to remain an animal.</speak>

            <speak chara="_graySnake">O sad King Zahhak, you destroyed your own soul in your attempt to surpass 「humanity」.</speak>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">I thought if your soul were to look down upon your body you would be able to leave the shackles of instincts behind.</speak>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">But in truth your soul was as disgraceful as your body.</speak>
            <show chara="graySnakeSilence" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">O pitiful King Zahhak, your soul refused to understand your flesh, so the flesh was dragged away by desire into an abyss.</speak>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">The serpents on your shoulders never desired human brains. All they wished was to help you in becoming a king as soon as possible.</speak>
            <show chara="graySnakeSpeak" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">Have you not noticed? The wisdom of the brains you ate became a part of you.</speak>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">That is why you became such a strong ruler and an excellent criminal.</speak>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">I called you 「the future King of Kings」 but alas, it seems you did not understand anything at all.</speak>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">Those serpents were only fulfilling your basic desires of the flesh.</speak>
            <show chara="graySnakeNormal" position="center"/>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">O foolish King Zahhak, life is deal you can't take back, and you didn't even know what you were trading.</speak>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">I gave you the potential to surpass humanity, and you wasted it 「playing house」.</speak>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">Zahhak, you have no longer the potential to 「surpass humanity」.</speak>
            <speak chara="_graySnake">Let us end this deal here.</speak>

                <p class="article-text">希罗多德将“长生军”描述为一支由重装步兵组成的精锐部队，其人数恰好保持在一万人不变。他声称，在这支部队中，任何战死、重伤或重病的士兵，都会立即被一名新的士兵取代。</p>
                <p class="article-text">然而，波斯方面的记载虽然印证了这样一支精锐禁军的存在，却称其为“伙伴军团”，而不是“长生军”。希罗多德、或是他的某个消息来源，可能是将古波斯语中的"Anûšiya"（“伙伴”）与"Anauša"（“长生者”）弄混了，并添油加醋地自行解释了一番。</p>
