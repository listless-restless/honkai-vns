                <p class="article-text">“蹴球”（玛雅语：pitz；纳瓦特尔语：ōllamalīztli）是一种发源于中美洲的球类运动，有超过三千年的历史。由于这项运动的历史非常悠久，它的详细规则随时间和地点会有所不同。一般而言，这是两人或两方对赛的竞技项目。</p>
                <p class="article-text">蹴球在古代具有宗教意义。球本身代表太阳，正式的比赛常被认为是天上的神明与地下世界的主宰之间的斗争。而最后（在正式比赛中），落败一方的领队会被斩首或取出心脏以作活祭品，他的头骨将作为新球的球心（当时的球都是实心橡胶球）。</p>

            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">The Red Team quickly claims a point! Bianka performed a service ace aimed at the opponent's body! 1:1!</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">The match is at a stalemate, neither team has scored for a while.</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">Oh! A mistake! Bianka made a mistake! She sent the ball flying to the audience! 1:2! Blue Team is in the lead!</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">Again! Red Team missed two times in a row!</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">The players at the back missed and sent the ball outside! Is the Red Team nervous due to their recent mistakes? 1:3!</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">The Red Team still keeps making straightforward shoots. Could they be perhaps aiming for the stone hoop?</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">Blue Team sent the ball unexpectedly to the back of the court! The Red Team made it in time but... it's a foul! They touched the ball with their hands! That's against the rules, folks! 1:4!</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">Blue Team is one point away from match point! What will the Red Team do!?</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">It seems the players of the Red Team are trying to communicate with each other using gestures... And it started! Seems the Red Team is going for an all or nothing shoot! The Blue Team is playing defensively, maintaining their formation...</speak>
