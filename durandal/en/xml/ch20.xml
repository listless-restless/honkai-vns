            <text>「It's the Republic's duty to protect this continent, this world」—— The invigorating knight declared about her country.</text>
            <text>From the archipelago at the North of the equator to the icy lands at the South, the Republic protects the entirety of the South American continent.</text>
            <text>On the other hand, they also must spare soldiers to protect the 「Huaca Tunnel」 which leads to the core of the planet. Thus, the frontiers are guarded by battalions like hers who take turns from their front lines duties——</text>
            <text>「However geographically speaking, there are very little threats at the frontiers of the Republic. This mission is like a half sightseeing trip.」</text>
            <text>According to Captain Shakespeare and other knights, it's impossible to cross the oceans of this world unless it's done via submarine.</text>
            <text>There are always waves of over 100 meters in the middle of the ocean—— For comparison, in the world the young Valkyries come from, there are at most waves of 20 to 30 meters caused by natural phenomenon such as tsunamis and typhoons.</text>
            <text>This world still holds many secrets... but the top priority of the Valkyries is to obtain information regarding the Ether Anchor.</text>
            <text>...And while they're at it, find the remaining gems to complete the Holy Sword.</text>
